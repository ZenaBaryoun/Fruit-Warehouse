# Fruit-Warehouse
Designed and implemented a grocery store stock, restock and profit system. 
Code tracked rates at which produce would go bad and the amount of produce in each category at any given time. 
It calculated profit, applied a discount rate for fruit that is not fresh, and tracked when it was time to order more stock.
